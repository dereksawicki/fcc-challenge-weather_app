# fcc-challenge-weather_app
This is an attempt at creating a weather app to the specifications of the freecodecamp intermediate challenge, "Show the Local Weather"

https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather
*The challenge asks you to change the background image according to the weather, I decided I didn't want to do that. 

This website uses the client's latitude and longitude to obtain and present data about the current weather from OpenWeatherApp.org. 

To get this working you'll need to be running a server, otherwise the cross-domain ajax requests cant go through. I used a google chrome web app, found here https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/related?hl=en.
